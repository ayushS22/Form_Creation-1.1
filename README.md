# Form_Creation-1.1
# HTML defines the structure of the form:
# Fields for Name, Email, and Role.
# required ensures users canâ€™t submit the form without filling these fields.
# CSS makes the form visually appealing and mobile-friendly:
# The layout adjusts automatically for small screens.
# Rounded corners, soft shadows, and smooth transitions.
# Steps to Test:
# Create two files: index.html and styles.css.
# Paste the respective codes into these files.
# Open index.html in your browser, and the form will appear.
